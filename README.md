# diabetes-cassandra-bigdatamodel
This project demonstrates my ability to work with Big Data technologies and datasets, specifically using an ELT approach for optimal performance. Feel free to observe repository, or simply visit the link for my video shown below : 

If running code that is in subdirectory of src run(to deal with relative import) :
< poetry run python -m src.subdirectory.filename >  <--- no .py at the end

Otherwise run:
< poetry run python src/filepath.py > <----- run from the root
